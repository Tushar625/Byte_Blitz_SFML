## Byte_Blitz_SFML

This is a very simple game engine based on SFML. It's still in early development phase. The manual for this game engine is not ready yet but every header file is well commented and contains a good description of its components and how to use them.

Till now I have only used it on windows with Visual Studio 2022.

To know more about how to set it up with Visual Studio 2022, check out **setup_details** folder.

**BBS** folder contains the main code base and **doc** folder has some documentations but that part is not yet finished.

## Main features:

 - Modular design
 - Multithreaded Game Loop (well synchronized Update and Render threads)
 - A proper State Machine
 - Buttons and Button_List to create Menus
 - AABB and Circle-AABB collision detection system
 - Floating point comparison functions
 - AABB position functions
 - A particle system to create Firecracker effect
 - User friendly Input and Window management systems

I shall create a proper manual discussing more about it in future...

## Examples

Here, I demonstrate some projects I made with this game engine:
