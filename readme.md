## Byte_Blitz_SFML

This is a very simple game engine based on **SFML 2.6.2**. It's still in early development phase. The manual for this game engine is not ready yet but every header file is well commented and contains a good description about its components and their usage.

Till now I have only used it on windows with Visual Studio 2022.

To know more about how to set it up with Visual Studio 2022, check out **setup_details** folder.

**BBS** folder contains the main code base and **doc** folder has some documentation but it's not finished yet.

## Main features:

 - Modular design
 - Multithreaded Game Loop (well synchronized Update and Render threads)
 - A proper State Machine
 - Buttons and Button_List to create Menus
 - AABB, Circle-AABB and Point-Polygon collision detection system
 - Floating point comparison functions
 - AABB position functions
 - Particle Systems to create Firecracker, Space Explosion and Rocket Exhaust effect
 - User friendly Input and Window management systems
 - Functions to access windows AppData folder to store and retrive game data
 - Simple Entity Component System

## Upcoming features:

 - Proper File Management Support
 - Support for SFML3
 - proper manual discussing more about these features
