## Byte_Blitz_SFML

This is a very simple game engine based on **SFML 2.6.2**. It's still in early development phase. The manual for this game engine is not ready yet but every header file is well commented and contains a good description about its components and their usage.

Till now I have only used it on windows with Visual Studio 2022.

To know more about how to set it up with Visual Studio 2022, check out **setup_details** folder.

**BBS** folder contains the main code base and **doc** folder has some documentation but it's not finished yet.

## Main features:

 - Modular design
 - Multithreaded Game Loop (well synchronized Update and Render threads)
 - A proper State Machine
 - Buttons and Button_List to create Menus
 - AABB and Circle-AABB collision detection system
 - Floating point comparison functions
 - AABB position functions
 - A particle system to create Firecracker effect
 - User friendly Input and Window management systems
 - Functions to access windows AppData folder to store and retrive game data 

***

I shall create a proper manual discussing more about these features in future...

## Examples

Here, I demonstrate some projects I made with this game engine:
