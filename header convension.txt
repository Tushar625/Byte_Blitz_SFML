Byte_Blitz game engine is made of several header files.

These header files performs different kinds of jobs and also contributes to the modular
design of this game engine.

>>>> These header files can be divided into two types:-

	General purpose header files. (Not specific to this game engine)

	Special purpose header files. (Makes sense inside this game engine only)

>>>> Rules for including header files in a General purpose header file of this game engine:-

Any element inside these header file must not depend upon a header file which was
included into a header file included to current dependent header file.

	eg:

	let,
	A.h is included into B.h (<A.h>B.h),
	B.h is included into C.h (<B.h>C.h)

	now any element of C.h must not depend upon A.h

>>>> Rules for including header files in a General purpose header file:-

The elements of these header file can depend on General purpose header file any header file inside
the General purpose header file or standard C++ header files.

>>>> A general rule for all header files:-

No. of header files included must be minimum, no extra unnecessary header files.

These header files must not depend on any header file in the source code where we want to
include them.

	eg:

	let,
	A.h is an header file of this game engine
	You want to include it into B.c source file, A.h must not require you to include any extra
	header file in B.c for it to work
