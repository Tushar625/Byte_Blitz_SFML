I usually use "Visual Studio 2022" to make games with "Byte Blitz SFML". In this document I shall
explain in details how I setup the visual studio project for this game engine.

{} Note:

	This game engine is in early development phase so, don't hasitate to modify the setup process as
	per your need, I only mention the setup process that has worked for me.


===============
Install "vcpkg"
===============


First, make sure that you have "Visual Studio 2022" and "Git" installed.

Now, open "cmd" from the folder where you want to keep "vcpkg" and run,

<=> "git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git"

This will create vcpkg folder inside current folder.

Now, open vcpkg folder, and execute the bootstrap script,

<=> "cd vcpkg"
<=> ".\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat"

The "bootstrap script" performs prerequisite checks and downloads the vcpkg executable. Now, "vcpkg"
is ready.

{} Note: 

	We shall run all the "vcpkg" commands from this vcpkg folder as we have not added vcpkg folder to
	environment variable "PATH" to keep this manual simple.

Now, link "vcpkg" installation with existing installation of "Visual Studio 2022"

<=> ".\vcpkg integrate install"

You can also unlink "vcpkg" installation from "Visual Studio 2022", if needed, though it's not necessary
now

<=> ".\vcpkg integrate remove"

{} Note:

	You can actually move this vcpkg folder to a new location after unlinking it, just don’t forget to
	link it up again before using it.

There’s a good video tutorial: https://youtube.com/watch?v=0h1lC3QHLHU&si=errT1UujH6AcZxOM


===============
Update "vcpkg"
===============


If you are installing "vcpkg" for the first time, this step is not necessary.

Open "cmd" inside vcpkg folder folder run,

<=> "git pull"
<=> ".\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat"

A simple pull request to the vcpkg github repository to update our local vcpkg repository with latest
commits. After that bootstrap…


=====================================
Creating "Visual Studio 2022" project
=====================================


First, we create a folder ("root") to keep our project, that will contain 3 other folders:

	"Source" Folder containing all the source files (including header files) necessary for the game.
	If you want to create a repository for your project create it inside this "Source" folder. I also
	provide a general format of source code for this game engine, inside setup folder, you can copy
	and paste it over to the "Source" folder of your project, to avoid some pain :).

	"Output" Folder containing the output file generated. Keep the resources (font, image or audio files)
	used by the game in this folder. If you create a repository in "Source" folder I recommand you to keep
	a copy of these resources in that repository too.

	"Project" Folder created by Visual Studio, that contains the solution and project files. To create it,
	
		Open "Visual Studio 2022" -> "Create a new project" -> "Empty Project" template.
	
		In subsequent menu,
		
			Tick "Place solution and project in the same directory",
			
			Enter absolute path to the "root" folder as "Location",
			
			Set a suitable name for your project,
			
			Click "Create".

{} Note:

	You can change the names of "Source" and "Output" folders, as you need. There’s no rule for that. If
	you ask me, I only change "Source" to "Project_name_Source", that works well for me.


=======================================
Setting up "Visual Studio 2022" project
=======================================


Using Visual Studio we can build our project either in "Debug" or "Release" mode. While developing our
application we use "Debug" mode, but we switch to "Release" mode if we want to publish or share a prototype
or finished application. You can switch between modes from "Build" -> "Configuration Manager" or directly
from the title bar. Use "x64" as platform.

Now that, we know about different modes, we can proceed to change some of our project properties.

Open "Project" -> "Project_name Properties"

Set "Configuration" to "All Configurations" and "Platform" to "All Platforms" to set geveral properties.

	Under "Configuration Properties" ->

	Setting C/C++ Standard:

		{} "General" -> "C++ Language Standard" : "ISO C++20 Standard"

		{} "General" -> "C Language Standard"   : "ISO C17 (2018) Standard"

	Setting the diretory where we put our output (.exe) file

		{} "General" -> "Output Directory"      : "$(SolutionDir)\..\Output\"

	Telling debugger in which directory we keep our output (.exe) file and other resources (image or audio files)

		{} "Debugging" -> "Working Directory"   : "$(SolutionDir)\..\Output\"

	Showing compiler the 'path' to the directory containing "Byte_Blitz_SFML" game engine

		{} "C/C++" -> "General" -> "Additional Include Directories" : (add) "absolute path to Byte_Blitz_SFML folder"

	Adding _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS macro to prevents compiler from displaying some silly errors and warnings

		{} "C/C++" -> "Preprocessor" -> "Preprocessor Definitions"  : (add) "_CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS"

	Enable manifest mode for "vcpkg"

		{} "vcpkg" -> "Use Vcpkg Manifest"   : Yes

Now, set "Configuration" to "Debug" and "Platform" to "All Platforms" to set some properties specific to
the "Debug" mode.	
	
	Setting "vcpkg" for dynamic linking

		{} "vcpkg" -> "Use Static Libraries" : "No"

		{} "vcpkg" -> "Use Dynamic CRT"      : "Yes"

	Linking standard libraries dynamically

		{} "C/C++" -> "Code Generation" -> "Runtime Library" : "Multi-threaded Debug DLL (/MDd)"

	Setting subsystem as console, as this provides a console window where we can print stuffs with std::cout,
	very help for debugging

		{} "Linker" -> "System" -> "Subsystem"               : "Console"

Now, set "Configuration" to "Release" and "Platform" to "All Platforms" to set some properties specific to
the "Release" mode.

	Setting "vcpkg" for static linking

		{} "vcpkg" -> "Use Static Libraries" : "Yes"

		{} "vcpkg" -> "Use Dynamic CRT"      : "No"

	Linking static versions of standard libraries

		{} "C/C++" -> "Code Generation" -> "Runtime Library"       : "Multi-threaded (/MT)"

	Adding SFML_STATIC macro to link to static versions of SFML libraries, getting rid of its dlls

		{} "C/C++" -> "Preprocessor" -> "Preprocessor Definitions" : (add) "SFML_STATIC"

	Setting subsystem as windows, as we want to release the game as a Windows Application

		{} "Linker" -> "System" -> "Subsystem"                     : "Windows"

	Adding sfml-main.lib library lets you use the simple "main" function instead of "WinMain" when the subsystem
	is "Windows"

		{} "Linker" -> "Input" -> "Addional Dependencies"          : (add) "sfml-main.lib"
	
	Adding winmm.lib library, else some errors show up

		{} "Linker" -> "Input" -> "Addional Dependencies"          : (add) "winmm.lib"

Now you should export these settings as a template, with, "Project" -> "Export Template...", so that you don't
have to set these everytime you make a B.B.S. (Byte Blitz SFML) game. Next time you make a game select this
template instead of "Empty Project".


==================================================
Install "SFML 2.6.2" with "vcpkg" in manifest mode
==================================================


After the project is created and settings are adjusted properly, we install SFML before adding the source
files.

To install "SFML 2.6.2" using vcpkg in manifest mode, copy the `vcpkg.json` file from this "setup_details"
folder and paste it into your project folder.

After that, build the project once with "Debug" Configuration, "x64" platform and once with "Release"
Configuration, "x64" platform to download and install the required packages into the `vcpkg_installed`
folder within the project folder. If the installation fails, update vcpkg and try again.


================================================
Adding Source files "Visual Studio 2022" project
================================================


Now, we create our source files and the header files in "Source" Folder, and add the source files to the project
as existing items, with, "Solution Explorer" -> right ckick "Source Files" -> "Add" -> "Existing Items".

I usually copy the byte_blitz_sfml_general_format.cpp provided in the Setup folder of this game engine and paste
it in the "Source" folder and rename it, "main.cpp", create necessary header files, include them into "main.cpp"
and add the "main.cpp" to my project. Set "Debug" or "Release" Configuration, "x64" platform, and compile or build
("Build" -> "Build Solution").
