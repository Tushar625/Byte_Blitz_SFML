Here the graphics folder contains "graphics2d_base.h" and "graphics2d_base_versions.h" which helps graphics2d.h
header file of system folder to access proper version of "graphics2d_base.h".

Why don't we employ such advanced versioning system with all the header files which will have multiple versions
in the future?

Because,

	No other header file is updated as frequently as "graphics2d_base.h".

	system folder serves as the platform inteface of this game engine which we don't want change as frequently
	as of "graphics2d_base.h", and the "graphics2d.h" has very little stuffs inside so, its safe to assume that
	it won't be updated as much as "graphics2d_base.h".

Now, if we create new versions of other header files,

	We will create a new version of game.h for each new versions of game_loop.h.

	We will use the technique used in "graphics2d_base_versions.h" to accomodate new versions in game.h by modifying
	game.h a bit.
