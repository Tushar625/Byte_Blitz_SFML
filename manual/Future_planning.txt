--------------------

{**}

(
	note:
	
	for now filling can be solid color (current color) Only, which is also default filling in future
	we may add texture or gradient filling options. For this we will keep functions like:
	
	set_filling_texture();
	set_filling_gradient();

	or we may create different object for texture or gradient and pass them to set_filling()

	use_default_filling();	// sets the system to use default filling or solid color

	For now I don't now how to get these textures so no exta functions related to filling.

***** This idea is a garbage *****

Standard macro (charb, stringb, path) and structures (RGB coord2d) must be put into a seperate
header files instead of multiple small header files.

Why this idea is a garbage?

Because we want to keep the modules separated but such a file will mix everything up, notice
how charb, stringb, path, RGB and coord2d all stays together in this header file. When game_loop
includes it for charb stringb it accedentally include all unnecessary stuffs, that's considered
to be a bad stuff in modular design. Also if we want to extract the game_loop header file from
the game engine we need to extract a copy of the header files attached to it also and it won't
look good if the header file has unnecessary useless stuffs it.

last reason is that what this header file will contain are fundamentally different things so it
makes no sense to keep them together and it will be difficult to upgrade also.
