Why did I dsign game.h in a way that user will not be required to inherit a class to write a game?

My initial thought about keeping both approaches valid as in console_game3.h was that; classless
approach is very programmer-friendly but we cannot create more than one Game objects (to run the
game a Game object is created implicitely); inheritance based approach is less intuitive but we
can create multiple derived game classes, create multiple objects (each represents a game) and
run them parallelly if needed, but this is never needed in real life, one core game object is
enough, on top of that running multiple game objects can cause issue: we can't use f1 object, so
we will have to create new frame objects; those game objects will share same input buffer so, input
system will break down; it will be too complex to make and play; having more than one games running
parallelly on the screen makes no sense.
