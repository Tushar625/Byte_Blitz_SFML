The console applications made with byte blitz can display colorful pictures as well as
black and white pictures.

The issue:-

To display colorful image a binary file, color.data is used. It contains the data necessary
for showing colors. It is loaded at runtime by the console applications made with byte blitz.
And to load it the application must be in the same folder as the color.data file. This is a
huge limitation as whenever we make an application in a folder we need to copy color.data
in that folder. Thus color.data is colpied to multiple folders. This is not good if the
application is made only for testing.

If the application fails to find color.data it will display black and white image.

The fix:-

color.data file is kept in graphics subfolder.

A new macro called PATH is defined in posfun.h, which gives the absolute path to the byte blitz
folder.

Each of draw.h has a macro COLOR_PATH which calculates the path to color.data using PATH macro.

Thus the console applications made with byte blitz normally access this color.data in the graphics
subdirectory while running.

Now, if you want to access color.data file from some different folder (say, the folder that contains
.exe file) you can define COLOR_PATH macro with a new path to a directory (this path can be a relative
path wrt the folder where the .exe file resides) containing color.data before including any draw.h
header file.
