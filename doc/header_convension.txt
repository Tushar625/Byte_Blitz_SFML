Byte_Blitz_SFML game engine is made of several header files.

These header files performs different kinds of jobs and also contributes to the modular
design of this game engine.

>>>> These header files can be divided into two types:-

	General purpose header files. (Not specific to this game engine)

	Special purpose header files. (Makes sense inside this game engine only)

>>>> Rules for General purpose header files:-

	Any header file included in a general purpose header file must be a general purpose header file
	or a standard C++ header file or a SFML header file.
	
	Any element defined in a general purpose header file can depend on only the header files directly
	included in this file

	example:

	let, A.h, B.h, C.h are general purpose header files

	A.h is included into B.h (<A.h>B.h),
	B.h is included into C.h (<B.h>C.h)

	now any element of C.h must not depend upon A.h

>>>> A general rule for all header files:-

	No. of header files included to a header file must be minimum, no extra unnecessary header files should
	be included.

	Header files must be self sufficient.

	eg:

	let,
	A.h is an header file of this game engine
	You want to include it into B.cpp source file, A.h must not require you to include any extra
	header file in B.c for it to work
