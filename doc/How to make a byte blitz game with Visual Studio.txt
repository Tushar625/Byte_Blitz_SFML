If you are using Visual Studio, this is how I suggest you to make Byte_Blitz games

>>>> Keep the source files seperated from the build or output files.

Make a folder (root) for your project that will contain 3 other folders:

	Project Folder created by Visual Studio (that contains the solution and project files).

	Source Folder containing all the source files (including header files) necessary for the game.
	This folder can have several subfolders in it if necessary.

	Output Folder containing the output file generated. Keep the resources (image or audio files)
	used by the game in this folder.

>>>> Project Creation.

While creating a project select "Console App" and place solution and project in the same directory
and enter the path to the root directory. This will create the first folder mentioned above
(generated by Visual Studio).

After a project is created a source code file will be generated autometically in the project folder
but we won't use it, we delete it.

We create our source files and the header files necessary in Source Folder mentioned above, and add
the main source files to the project as existing items, one can also add the header files but its
not necessary if those header files are already included in the source files added to the project.

Afore-said step actually adds the source files to the project, and these source files are all compiled
to generate the output.

>>>> Settings.

go to project -> properties

[Set C/C++ Standard]

set Configuration Properties -> General -> C++ Language Standard: ISO C++20

set Configuration Properties -> General -> C Language Standard: ISO C17 (2018)

[Selecting the diretory where we put our output (.exe) file]

set Configuration Properties -> General -> Output Directory: $(SolutionDir)\..\Output\

[Telling debugger in which directory we keep our output (.exe) file and other resources (image or audio files)]

set Configuration Properties -> Debugging -> Working Directory: $(SolutionDir)\..\Output\

[Showing compiler the 'path' to the directory containing Byte_Blitz game engine]

Add to Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> General -> External Include Directories: C:/Users/Tushar Das/Desktop/desktop/New C++ 2024/packages/Byte_Blitz_SFML/

[Following field takes some macro that are added at the top of each source files before compiling,
_CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS macro prevents compiler from displaying some silly errors and warnings]

set Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> Preprocessor -> Preprocessor Definitions: _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS

[Follow step is only needed if you need play any music (audio file) in your application. To play any audio file
you need 'winmm.lib' static library, which will be linked to your application by the linker. While setting the
following option you may find some existing values already written there, just append 'winmm.lib' in that list
seperated by ';']

set Configuration Properties -> Linker -> Input -> Additional Dependencies: [add] winmm.lib

>>>> Conclusion.

After all these steps, write the source code and build the solution, after its built successfully, hit F5 to
run it.

To open the project double click on '.sln' file in the folder created by Visual Studio.
