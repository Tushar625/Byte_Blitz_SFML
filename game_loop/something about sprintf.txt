Now a days, I try to remove unnecessary header files, that were previously included into various
header files under byte blitz game engine

In game loop we have used sprintf()

Confusion:

	Which header file contains sprintf(), and do I need any namespace or not.

Situation:

	iostream and std namespace was included in game_loop.h but they are mostly necessary.

Solution:

	I found we access sprintf() through the following c++ header files, through it actually belongs
	to stdio.h

		iostream
		cstdio
		string

	Here I don't want to include iostream and string, so I used cstdio.

	Now the description of cstdio I read from internet, told that it include sprintf() in std namespace
	but when I looked at the code of cstdio, I did not find any mension of std namespace, even sprintf()
	was a part of the global namespace.

	At the end as most of the websites was telling that sprintf is a part of std namespace, I tried
	std::sprintf() and it worked, so I included cstdio and called std::sprintf() in the final version game3.h
